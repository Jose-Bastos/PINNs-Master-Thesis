# Automated Physical Law discovery from Data using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

## Intro and Motivation

This is the repository of my Master Thesis titled **Automated Physical Law Discovery from data using Deep Learning**. The final PDF version of my thesis is **blblabla.pdf**, and this repository has all the code used to produce the results in it.

My thesis is the result of a year long internship in Flanders Make, a Research Centre located in Leuven (Belgium), which tries to make bridge Research and Academia, and ,nowadays, works more on Automation, Optimization, and Machine Learning (Deep Learning  included) with focus on industrial settings.
The main goals of the internship were:

1. Understand what are PINNs: main concepts, advantages/disadvantages, use cases, and state of the art techniques and implementations.
2. Use PINNs to determine the underlying Physical Laws of 2 systems: Axially Moving String and Weather.
3. Use PINNs to forecast the 2 prevuious system's behaviour.


## Structure and Guide 

This repositoryis divided in 2 folders, one for each systems we used PINNs on: the axially moving string and the weather.
